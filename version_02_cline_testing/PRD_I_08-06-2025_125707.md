Okay, I will generate a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for rebuilding the existing codebase while generating HTML pages from CSV files using Gulp.

# Product Requirements Document: Codebase Rebuild and CSV to HTML Conversion

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding the existing codebase (version_01) into a new version (version_02), and implementing a feature to generate HTML pages from CSV files using Gulp.  The existing codebase consists of Shell Script, Python, and PHP files. The rebuild aims to improve maintainability, scalability, and introduce new functionality for CSV to HTML conversion. This document details the goals, requirements, architecture, and implementation plan for this project.

## 2. Problem Statement & Market Opportunity

*   **Problem:** The current codebase (version_01) is a mix of Shell Script, Python, and PHP, which may lead to maintainability issues, code redundancy, and scalability limitations. The lack of a streamlined process for converting CSV data to HTML format necessitates manual effort or custom scripting, which is inefficient and error-prone.
*   **Market Opportunity:** By rebuilding the codebase (version_02), we can modernize the architecture, improve code quality, and introduce automated processes that enhance productivity. The CSV to HTML conversion feature addresses a common need in data presentation and reporting, which can open up new use cases and opportunities for the application.

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics

*   **Goals:**
    *   Rebuild the existing codebase into version_02 with improved architecture and maintainability.
    *   Implement a feature to automatically generate HTML pages from CSV files using Gulp.
    *   Improve overall application performance and scalability.
    *   Reduce manual effort in data presentation and reporting.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   **Code Quality:** Reduction in code complexity as measured by static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
    *   **Performance:** Improvement in page load times and data processing speed by at least 20%.
    *   **Maintainability:** Reduction in the number of bugs reported post-rebuild by 30%.
    *   **Adoption:** Number of users leveraging the CSV to HTML conversion feature.
    *   **Efficiency:** Time saved in generating HTML reports from CSV data.

## 4. Functional Requirements

    *   Identify and document the functionalities of the existing codebase (version_01).
    *   Design and implement the new architecture for version_02.
    *   Migrate the existing functionalities to the new codebase.
    *   Ensure all existing functionalities are working as expected in version_02.
*   **CSV to HTML Conversion:**
    *   Accept a CSV file as input.
    *   Allow users to specify HTML template for the output.
    *   Provide options to customize the HTML output (e.g., column selection, formatting).
    *   Generate HTML output based on the CSV data and selected template.
    *   Provide error handling and reporting for invalid CSV files or templates.
    *   Implement Gulp tasks to automate the conversion process.
    *   Support large CSV files efficiently (performance benchmark: able to process 10MB CSV file in under 5 seconds).
*   **User Interface (If Applicable):**
    *   Provide a user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files, selecting templates, and customizing the output.
    *   Display a preview of the generated HTML.
    *   Allow users to download the generated HTML file.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   The application should handle a large number of concurrent users without performance degradation.
    *   CSV to HTML conversion should be fast and efficient.
    *   Page load times should be under 2 seconds.
*   **Security:**
    *   Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
    *   Ensure secure handling of user data.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   The application should be easily scalable to accommodate future growth in users and data.
    *   The architecture should support horizontal scaling.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase should be well-documented and easy to understand.
    *   Follow coding standards and best practices.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   The application should be highly reliable and available.
    *   Implement error handling and logging to facilitate debugging.
*   **Usability:**
    *   The application should be intuitive and easy to use.
    *   Provide clear and concise error messages.

## 6. Technical Architecture Overview

*   **Programming Languages:**
    *   Choose appropriate languages based on the architecture (e.g., Python for backend, JavaScript for frontend).
*   **Frameworks:**
    *   Leverage modern web frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for the frontend.
    *   Consider using a Python framework like Flask or Django for the backend.
*   **Gulp:**
    *   Use Gulp as a task runner to automate the CSV to HTML conversion process.
*   **Database (If Applicable):**
    *   Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) based on the application's data storage needs.
*   **Server Infrastructure:**
    *   Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
    *   Use containerization technologies like Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
*   **API Design:**
    *   Design RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk                                      | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codebase rebuild complexity               | Conduct thorough code analysis and planning before starting the rebuild. Break down the rebuild into smaller, manageable tasks.      |
| Performance issues with large CSV files   | Implement optimized data processing algorithms and use appropriate libraries for CSV parsing.                                         |
| Security vulnerabilities                  | Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Follow secure coding practices.                                               |
| Integration issues between components     | Define clear APIs and integration points. Implement thorough testing and integration testing.                                          |
| Unexpected dependencies and library conflicts | Use dependency management tools (e.g., pip, npm) to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. Create isolated environments (e.g., virtualenv, Docker). |
| Lack of documentation on existing system | Dedicate time to reverse engineering the existing codebase and documenting its functionality.                                          |
| Incompatible CSV formats                 | Implement flexible CSV parsing that can handle different delimiters, encodings, and quoting rules.                                   |
