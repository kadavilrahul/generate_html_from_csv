  "guidelines": {
    "modularity_constraint": "The strict 150-line limit per code file or function is a core requirement to enforce modularity, enhance readability, simplify debugging, and improve overall maintainability. The AI should actively decompose complex problems into smaller, independent functions or modules to meet this constraint. This aligns with the 'Modularization of Thoughts' (MoT) principle. If a component exceeds this limit, it must be broken down into logical sub-components with clear interfaces.",
    "context_management": "To maximize effectiveness and prevent 'hallucinations': Leverage external context by always referring to the PRD (`PRD_[timestamp].md`), `project_info.txt`, and consulting the `reference/` folder for tutorials, documentation, and established patterns. Maintain project consistency by following established patterns and conventions from existing codebase.",
    "iterative_refinement": "Development is iterative. Expect to: 1. Generate initial implementations; 2. Receive human review and feedback; 3. Refine code based on targeted instructions; 4. Test and validate changes; 5. Document lessons learned. This continuous feedback loop is essential for quality and adherence to standards.",
    "code_review_strategy": "When reviewing code: Adopt a critical stance regardless of code origin. Explicitly state when 'another AI wrote the code' to encourage unbiased critique. Focus on improvements, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and best practices. Consider scalability and maintainability implications. Validate against project requirements and constraints. Suggest specific, actionable improvements.",
    "testing_and_debugging": "Quality assurance practices: Generate comprehensive unit tests including happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions. Provide debugging assistance by identifying root causes, explaining issues, and providing direct solutions. Consider integration testing and performance testing to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.",
    "documentation_and_version_control": "Documentation standards: Generate inline comments and docstrings for all code. Document all public interfaces and methods (API documentation). Provide practical usage examples with sample data. Generate clear, informative Git commit messages explaining the 'why' behind changes.",
    "security_considerations": "Security best practices: Always consider security implications of generated code. Validate inputs and sanitize outputs. Handle sensitive data appropriately. Follow security patterns from `reference/security/`. Implement proper authentication and authorization where needed. Consider common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).",
    "performance_optimization": "Performance guidelines: Consider time and space complexity. Optimize database queries and API calls. Implement appropriate caching strategies. Monitor resource usage patterns. Follow performance patterns from `reference/performance/`."
