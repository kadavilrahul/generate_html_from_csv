    "instructions": "You are an expert in Linux shell scripting and Python project setup. Your task is to generate a 'run.sh' script that automates the entire process of setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the 'prd_generator.py' script. The script should be executable on a standard Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).",
    "requirements": [
      "The script must be named 'run.sh'.",
      "It should start with a shebang: `#!/bin/bash`.",
      "Include comments for each major step.",
      "Ensure proper error handling (e.g., `set -e`).",
      "Steps to include:",
      "1.  **Environment Setup**: Create and activate a Python virtual environment.",
      "2.  **Dependency Installation**: Install all required packages listed in the project's dependencies file (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python, `package.json` for Node.js, `pom.xml` for Java Maven, etc.). Specify the appropriate package manager.",
      "3.  **Execution**: Run the project's main script or entry point. The script should handle any necessary user input during execution.",
      "4.  **Cleanup (Optional)**: Add a commented-out section for deactivating the virtual environment or cleaning up if necessary."
