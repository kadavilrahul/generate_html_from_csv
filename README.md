1. Move to the folder where you want to generate HTML files.

    Example: The domain folder where SSL is installed, 
    
    `/var/www/your_domain.com`

    Optionally open the folder in VS code to easily modify files and use terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadavilrahul/generate_html_from_csv .
```

3. Install Apache and Postgres on new server if not already installed

```bash
bash apache_postgres.sh
```

4. Install SSL on the server for your domain or subdomain if not already installed.
   Make sure to point the DNS correctly

```bash
bash maindomain.sh
```
      or

```bash
bash subdomain.sh
```

5. Modify following lines in setup.sh
```bash 
706, 707, 769, 519, 520, 548, 549, 550, 551
```
Else create a blank file named replace.sh and paste the content provided to you to the file and then run replace.sh.

```bash 
bash replace.sh
```

7. Run packages.sh
