```bash 
706, 707, 769, 519, 520, 548, 549, 550, 551
```
- Else create a blank file named replace.sh and paste the content provided to you into the file and then run replace.sh.
- Note: Do not copy paste the file itself using SFTP rather use nano command so that permission issue doesn't arise.

```bash 
nano replace.sh
```

```bash 
bash replace.sh

```bash
bash data/transfer.sh
```

6. Update SSL to serve static HTML pages. Open this file and follow instructions.
Modify the domain name
Readd this
```bash
data/SSL_for_static_HTML.txt
```
or

```bash
bash data/update_apache_config.sh your_domainname.com
```
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

7. On the new server run package installation script

```bash 
bash data/packages.sh
```
