```bash 
706, 707, 769, 519, 520, 548, 549, 550, 551
```
- Else create a blank file named replace.sh and paste the content provided to you into the file and then run replace.sh.

bash data/update_apache_config.sh your_domainname.com
```
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

8. On the new server run package installation script

```bash 
bash data/packages.sh
```
