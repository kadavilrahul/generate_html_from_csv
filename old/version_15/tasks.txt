Improve product.ejs template to make it more professional
Dont make major changes without asking me first
Make reusable elements so that disk space is reduced
Make category folder inside public/product and public/images so that html pages and their images remain in separate folders wrt to their catgories
Take category name from fifth colum name categories of csv file
Once above is done get approval
Next improve product_with_chatbot.ejs template
Keep lines of code minimum
